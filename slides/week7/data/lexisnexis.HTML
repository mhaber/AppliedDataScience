<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Centre parties and centrist candidacies come ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">...Think Justin Trudeau's revived centre-left Liberals in Canada, or Spain's new fourth party, Cuidadanos (Citizens). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> En Marche movement is different from all of them, because it is so personally focused, completely untested and in many ways peculiar. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">...Chaban-Delmas and the socialist-communist unity candidacy of Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand to become president. Giscard was a centrist of the right, while </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a centrist of the left (though he occasionally denies it). But they share many traits - youthful, modernising, liberal on social issues, technocratic, financial backgrounds, Anglophone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early on, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> benefitted from the excitement of being new and interesting just when the old parties were looking incapable and tarnished. The uselessness of Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande's Socialist ...</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">...M&eacute;lenchon has sucked votes and energy from the official Socialist candidate. As a result, all four main contenders - Le Pen, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Fillon and M&eacute;lenchon - go into the final weekend with a chance, probably in that order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet if the polls are right - a big if - </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will overturn the French political order when the contest concludes in less than three weeks. His problems will be immediate, above ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">...European continent to which, in spite of Brexit, Britain remains tied by geography, history, trade, culture and sympathy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory would be much the best outcome among the available choices, not just for France but for the EU. And that means, though Theresa May will be loth to admit it, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> win would ultimately be good for Britain too. Negotiating with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over the next two years will not be easy, because he understandably shares the same priority as Germany and most of the EU27 that the union must be defended and made stronger. On every other count, though, he would be by far the least worst of the options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency is unlikely be robust and strong. Many of his reforms will be opposed. But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would avoid the inward lurch that Le Pen or M&eacute;lenchon would attempt, or the deregulatory anarchy that Fillon might try. A win for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would also be a harbinger - inevitably imperfect but real all the same - for the importance of future-focused centrist politics, economic and ...</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">...three months ago. But as polls narrow and a third of the electorate remains undecided, the race has become increasingly uncertain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters concede that the last few days of campaigning will be tough and unpredictable. Although polls have shown he could win a second round runoff on 7 May, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first has to make it to the final round - and that is not by any means guaranteed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new president,&quot; said one butcher as he posed for a selfie with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the market. &quot;He hasn't won yet!&quot; came the cry from the scrum of media recording the moment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to vote first,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reminded him gently.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">...same is true for the other frontrunner, the far-right Front National's Marine Le Pen, who had been roughly level with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the front of the pack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> displays a calm image of serenity, but I'm not sure that's the case - he's knotted up inside</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is normal for presidential frontrunners to dip in the polls in the final weeks of a French election campaign, but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Le Pen's slump has been accompanied by a concerted rise by the hard-left Jean-Luc M&eacute;lenchon and the scandal-...</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> electorate has always had a higher proportion of wavering voters than other leading candidates. His challenge this week is to highlight the novelties in his policy platform, and perhaps come up with new headline-grabbing measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can sense </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign is fragile</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an election campaign that has focused more on candidates' personalities than any single topic, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;neither left nor right&quot; manifesto has not seen any single measure boldly standing out. Canvassers pointed to his promise to ...</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">...Some asked about the dip in the polls. &quot;Not long ago, everyone said it was impossible for Emmanuel </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to get this far but we proved them wrong, and now we're so close to the finish,&quot; the canvasser urged one voter in his 40s who was undecided between voting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or returning to his &quot;natural party&quot; and choosing Fillon on the right. &quot;I'm still not sure what Emmanuel </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> really stands for,&quot; the voter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've gone in a few days from 'we can win' to 'we can lose',&quot; one MP in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> circle was quoted telling Le Monde last week. &quot;There's a lot of tension. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> displays a calm image of serenity, but I'm not sure that's the case - he's knotted up inside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not alone in facing an uncertain first round vote on this Sunday. &quot;After the highs of a fortnight ago, you can sense Emmanuel </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign is fragile, but perhaps not at the point where it's going to shatter,&quot; said Philippe Braud, an analyst ...</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Le Pen also under investigation for misusing public funds, this time at the European parliament, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a former investment banker and economy minister, sought on Monday to dismiss persistent rumours that he too may have something to hide....</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've always paid all my tax in France and had all my accounts in France,&quot; said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who resigned from Hollande's government last year to launch his En Marche! movement and has campaigned as the candidate &quot;neither of the left nor of the right&quot;. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A French anti-corruption group, Anticor, raised concerns in March about supposed discrepancies in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> disclosure of assets, but the country's public transparency watchdog said it had found no inconsistencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several polls modelling possible second-round permutations have suggested that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Macron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would win the runoff whoever he is against, while Le Pen would lose.
